# CTFd King of the Hill

A small binary to check which CTFd user owns a file.

## Usage

The binary is intended to be run on a secure machine, from where it can check mounted network-shares from a compromised machine.
It will get the contents of the flag-file and award the owning user with a preconfigured award.

## Disclaimer

This is a *proof-of-concept*.
Lots of stuff could be done better, use at your own risk and shame&hellip;
